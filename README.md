# VoiceChatAI üéôÔ∏è


VoiceChatAI is an interactive voice-based chatbot that combines speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech synthesis to create seamless voice conversations. Built with DialoGPT-medium, it offers context-aware responses and natural conversation flow.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Voice Interaction**: Seamless speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains conversation history for coherent dialogue
- **Multiple Voice Options**: Choose between male and female text-to-speech voices
- **Modern UI**: Clean interface with audio visualization and playback controls
- **Speed Control**: Adjust playback speed for generated responses
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on all modern browsers and devices

## ü§î Why This Tech Stack?
- This project was originally built as part of a hackathon, emphasizing speed, simplicity, and accessibility. To keep the proof-of-concept (POC) free and lightweight:
  - LLM Choice: The DialoGPT-medium model was selected to provide reasonable conversation flow without incurring costs associated with premium models like GPT-4 or Claude. Upgrading to such models could significantly enhance response quality but would require API keys and a paid subscription.
  - TTS Engine: Whisper-small and fast text-to-speech (TTS) was chosen for its balance between speed and accuracy, ensuring quick responses even on standard compute resources. For more accurate and expressive speech synthesis, heavier or paid options could be explored in the future.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
